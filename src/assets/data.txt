Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [lava] [floor] is an [instant]-[kill] unless you have a [metal] [cap] which you DO NOT have right now!
DUUNNN, DUN DUN DA DUUNN, go the [trumpets], but it is not their time. "OH SHIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!" screams whiskey as he [struggles] to [transition] [properly]. But he cannot, for he is [pepega]. "[EVERY] [TIME]! wding [KEKW]" yells [chat]. But it is [chat] that yells THAT every time, for THEY are [Pepega] as well. Who has the [braincell]? Nobody. Nobody has the [brain] [cell].
'[high] [viewer] [interaction]' so why [everybody] just [saying] the same mennigles [singles] [words]?
I’m 59 and [new] to [twitch]. Is [bussin] good? Is it like a [bussy]? Can a [bussy] be [bussin]? Are they [related]? My [grand] [son] keeps using this word and any [help] will do. God Bless
if u dont unblock [deez] [nutz] im [unsubscribing] the [twitch] [channel] and im going to make sure no one [joins] [anymore]
“[Last] [one]”, Whiskey says, “I [PROMISE] this [time]!” as [chat] begs him to [stop]. But he [ignores] them, for he cannot [stop]. “You’re almost [broke]!” but [Whiskey] brushes them off. “This one’s for the [believers]!!” he [yells], as he [loses] his last $25 on [scratchers]. “FUCK!” he [yells], right before [stream] [cuts] [out], and he is never seen again.
"Okay okay, this one guys, [GUARANTEED] [WIN]. [GUARANTEED]." [Whiskey] reassured his [chat]. However, several "BUH" sounds later, he managed an unfortunate 31st [place]. In a [panic], he shouted "OKAY OKAY, THAT ONE WAS JUST FOR [THE] [DRAMA], [CHAT], I SWEAR!" he said, desperately trying to [convince] his [chat] he wasn't just a [silly] [dingo].
"[Chat], this is [100]% a [believer] [win], I promise" [whiskey] says for the 100th time as the [chat] fills with [COPIUM]s and [KEKW]s. Soon [mario] falls off screen as the [chat] fills with [OMEGALUL]s. "[Chat], that was not a normal [map]! That was at least an [expert]!" [whiskey] cries as the [believers] [lose] yet another bet. And the [moral] of the [story]? Never [believe] in the [cute] and [smelly] dingo!
There was a [day] when I had [ample] [cheddar]. [Times] were [good]. Then I started [believing]. I [lost] [everything]. Now, I’m lucky to get above [double] [digits]
Our [happy] [yellow] [dingo], try as he [might], is [encountering] [major] [malfunctions] with the [current] [level], [round], or [game]. His [predicament] is considered very [humorous] to his onlookers, more colloquially known as the [chat]. In other words, [LMAO] [SKILL] [ISSUE] [KEKW]
Hey, everyone! I'm [WhiskeyDingo], or [Whiskey] for short! I've been an [avid] [gamer] for the [majority] of my [life], and I'd like to [share] that [passion] with all of you! I mainly play [FPS] games like [Overwatch], [Pubg] and used to be an [old] [school] [TF2] [vet]. However, I'll be [playing] all sorts of [fun] [stuff]! So [grab] a [drink], [kick] [back] and [enjoy] while I make a [fool] of [myself].
God i love [pizzaface]. This one of a kind masterpiece really makes my [entire] [life] [worth] [it]. All these years of [existing] on this [miserable] [planet], its all worth it after [playing] this game. This game will be the [breaking] [point] in finding the [solution] to global [warming], world [hunger], and the growing [water] [climate]. [Pizzaface] will forever live on in our [hearts]
You notice a wall of [text] in [twitch] [chat] and your hand instinctively goes to [the] [mouse]. You [scroll] up to [stop] the chat elevator and [read] the [pasta], indulging in its delights... You soon realize that this [pasta] [conveys] no [information] nor is it particularly [witty] or [funny]. Nevertheless, you [drag] your [mouse] across, hit Ctrl+[C], then Ctrl+[V] and press [Enter]
How do I get my dingo to stop going "[Whiskey] [Mode]" during streams? TLDR; My dingo says "[Whiskey] [Mode] [activated]" when he [starts] to stream, [growls] and [acts] [unskilled] at [video] [games], and then says "[Whiskey] [Mode] [off]" when he stops, and then [pretends] not to [remember] afterward. I really love my dingo and he's always been [great] at games. But recently he’s been [acting] [really] [weird].
[GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. 
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of [skill] and [streamer] compatibilty, [WhiskeyDingo] is the best at [having] [issues]? He has a high [confidence] stat, which makes him [more] [likely] to [mess] [up] while [attempting] a [risky] move. He also has a high [pepega] stat, meaning he is more [likely] to [forgor]. He [throws] like a [Heisman] [winner] every time he streams, it's [fucking] [impressive].
Does [Morbius] actually say “[It’s] [Morbing] [time]” in the movie? I was going to [watch] this [movie] until I heard [critic] [reviews] and changed my mind. But now I’ve been [seeing] a [meme] circulating online by people who’ve seen the [movie], apparently the best [scene] in the [movie] is when [Morbius] says “[It’s] [Morbing] [time]” and then proceeds to [morb] [everyone] in the [room]. Does this really happen? Because if this is actually in the movie, I will buy [tickets] immediately.
