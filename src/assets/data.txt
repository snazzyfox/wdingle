Does [Morbius] actually say “[It’s] [Morbing] [time]” in the movie? I was going to [watch] this [movie] until I heard [critic] [reviews] and changed my mind. But now I’ve been [seeing] a [meme] circulating online by people who’ve seen the [movie], apparently the best [scene] in the [movie] is when [Morbius] says “[It’s] [Morbing] [time]” and then proceeds to [morb] [everyone] in the [room]. Does this really happen? Because if this is actually in the movie, I will buy [tickets] immediately.
THE 3 STAGES OF FALLING ASLEEP TO WHISKEY: wding[Blankey] wding[Comf] wding[BEDGE]
Whiskey says better [copy] [pastas] but we all know he like the [old] [ones]!
DUUNNN, DUN DUN DA DUUNN, go the [trumpets], but it is not their time. "OH SHIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!" screams whiskey as he [struggles] to [transition] [properly]. But he cannot, for he is [pepega]. "[EVERY] [TIME]! wding [KEKW]" yells [chat]. But it is [chat] that yells THAT every time, for THEY are [Pepega] as well. Who has the [braincell]? Nobody. Nobody has the [braincell].
"[Chat], this is [100]% a [believer] [win], I promise" [whiskey] says for the 100th time as the [chat] fills with [COPIUM]s and [KEKW]s. Soon [mario] falls off screen as the [chat] fills with [OMEGALUL]s. "[Chat], that was not a normal [map]! That was at least an [expert]!" [whiskey] cries as the [believers] [lose] yet another bet. And the [moral] of the [story]? Never [believe] in the [cute] and [smelly] dingo!
Hey, everyone! I'm [WhiskeyDingo], or [Whiskey] for short! I've been an [avid] [gamer] for the [majority] of my [life], and I'd like to [share] that [passion] with all of you! I mainly play [FPS] games like [Overwatch], [Pubg] and used to be an [old] [school] [TF2] [vet]. However, I'll be [playing] all sorts of [fun] [stuff]! So [grab] a [drink], [kick] [back] and [enjoy] while I make a [fool] of [myself].
wdingWIGGLE Whiskey [bad]. Makes [believers] [sad]. wdingWIGGLE
Whiskey you [dingus] stop [falling] off the [train], it [kills] you wdingWIGGLE
I’m 59 and [new] to [twitch]. Is [bussin] good? Is it like a [bussy]? Can a [bussy] be [bussin]? Are they [related]? My [grand] [son] keeps using this word and any [help] will do. God Bless
"MAAAAHDS!" the [yellow] dog [roars], his [bellowing] [voice] startling the [mods] awake. They start to wonder why they've been [woken] up. "MAAAAHDS!" the [chat] follows up, unrelentingly echoing the [yellow] [dog]'s command. The [mods] become [scared] and [run] the [other] [way]. "[GAMBA] [GAMBA] [GAMBA]" the [chat] continues to [roar]. One [brave] [mod] must face [chat], and they all look at each other, waiting for one to [speak] [first]. "I'll do it", one says, and begins [creating] the [gamba]. The [brave] [hero] finally quells the [chat].
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [lava] [floor] is an [instant]-[kill] unless you have a [metal] [cap] which you DO NOT have right now!
God i love [pizzaface]. This one of a kind masterpiece really makes my [entire] [life] [worth] [it]. All these years of [existing] on this [miserable] [planet], its all worth it after [playing] this game. This game will be the [breaking] [point] in finding the [solution] to global [warming], world [hunger], and the growing [water] [climate]. [Pizzaface] will forever live on in our [hearts]
if u dont unblock [deez] [nutz] im [unsubscribing] the [twitch] [channel] and im going to make sure no one [joins] [anymore]
by all that is [holy] we [summon] [FishMoley]
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! You [need] the [metal] [cap], which you [DO] [HAVE] right now!
How do I get my dingo to stop going "[Whiskey] [Mode]" during streams? TLDR; My dingo says "[Whiskey] [Mode] [activated]" when he [starts] to stream, [growls] and [acts] [unskilled] at [video] [games], and then says "[Whiskey] [Mode] [off]" when he stops, and then [pretends] not to [remember] afterward. I really love my dingo and he's always been [great] at games. But recently he’s been [acting] [really] [weird].
Step 1: Go against the [advice] of the [chat], and [place] some of your [processed] [cheese] [products] in the [paws] of the [dingo]. Step 2: Proceed to [lose] all of said [product], for [Whiskey] had [failed] again. Step 3: Be so [moved] by such a [tragedy] that you are [brought] to [tears], and [dispense] those [tears] in the only [item] you can afford now, the [humble] [Television] [Dinner].  And now, I conclude, with an unsure [statement] of the twelfth letter. Could it be [true]?
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [zoomies] function has been [activated] and will make you [REALLY] [FAST]. This will [insta]-[kill] you most of the time, be [careful]!
The [time] has [arrived], where someone sends in a [donation] that [contains] a [small] [piece] of [information]. It has been [identified] as the 12th [member] of the [English] set of [glyphs]. Its [presence] is made even more apparent by having this [info] [repeated]. The amount of [repetitions] are [irrelevant], but they still never fail to bring [humor] to us [onlookers] and [confusion] to the [dingo]. In other words, LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
“[Last] [one]”, Whiskey says, “I [PROMISE] this [time]!” as [chat] begs him to [stop]. But he [ignores] them, for he cannot [stop]. “You’re almost [broke]!” but [Whiskey] brushes them off. “This one’s for the [believers]!!” he [yells], as he [loses] his last $25 on [scratchers]. “FUCK!” he [yells], right before [stream] [cuts] [out], and he is never seen again.
can you [commission] [vore] on [twitter] and post it Smile
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! [Rolling] off the [board] will cause you to [FALL] [OUT], which you [DON'T] [WANT] right now!
Now we watch as the [Whiskussy] canis lupus [dingo] (also known as “[WhiskeyDing0]”) prepares for his [nightly] [meal]. “MAAAAAHDS!” He [shouts], to [attract] his prey. “This is a [GUARANTEED] [believer] [win]!” He says, [baiting] his targets into [exposing] their [vulnerable] [cheddar]. Once his prey lowers their guard, he [strikes]. Throwing for [content] in order to [steal] his target’s [precious] [cheddar].
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! You need to get [two] [more] [jackpots] which can be [difficult] unless you have [good] [luck], which you DO NOT have right now!
I like to [creep] around my [home] and act like a [goblin]. I don't know why but I just [enjoy] doing [this]. Maybe it’s my way of [dealing] with [stress] or something but I just do it about [once] every [week]. Generally I’ll [carry] around a [sack] and [creep] [around] in a sort of [crouch]-[walking] [position] making [goblin] [noises], then I’ll [walk] around my [house] and [pick] up various different “[trinkets]” and put them in my [bag] while [saying] stuff like “I’ll be [having] [that]” and [laughing] [maniacally] in my [goblin] [voice].
'[high] [viewer] [interaction]' so why [everybody] just [saying] the same mennigles [singles] [words]?
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [extreme] [bleeding] is an [slow] and [painful] [kill] unless you have [godmode] or [healing] [commands] which will make chat [VERY] [ANGRY]!
[Whiskey] as [impostor]: "IM NOT THE [IMPOSTOR] BLAH BLAH BLAH" YAPPP
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [walls] are [NOCLIP] right now so you'll move [right] [through] them, unless you're [playing] [fair] which you are NOT!
If you, or anyone you know, suffers from a [gambling] [addiction], please call 55-[GAMBA]. That's 55-[GAMBA]. [Addiction] is hard to [overcome] without [help]. Let us be that [help].
wding[CHAT] According to all [known] [laws] of [gaming], there is no way the [dingo] should be able to [fail], the [dingo] [however], [fails] anyway, because the [dingo] doesn’t care what [believers] say is [impossible] wding[CHAT]
There was a [day] when I had [ample] [cheddar]. [Times] were [good]. Then I started [believing]. I [lost] [everything]. Now, I’m lucky to get above [double] [digits]
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [salmon] [water] can get on your [dish] very [easily] unless you have the [perk] that doesn't [spill] the [food], which you DON'T HAVE right now!
Our [happy] [yellow] [dingo], try as he [might], is [encountering] [major] [malfunctions] with the [current] [level], [round], or [game]. His [predicament] is considered very [humorous] to his onlookers, more colloquially known as the [chat]. In other words, [LMAO] [SKILL] [ISSUE] [KEKW]
[GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof]. [GOOBYAPP] [Woof].

Chat [WATCH] [OUT]! Whiskey [wants] some [better] [copy] [pastas], which you [DO] [NOT] [have] right now!
You notice a wall of [text] in [twitch] [chat] and your hand instinctively goes to [the] [mouse]. You [scroll] up to [stop] the chat elevator and [read] the [pasta], indulging in its delights... You soon realize that this [pasta] [conveys] no [information] nor is it particularly [witty] or [funny]. Nevertheless, you [drag] your [mouse] across, hit Ctrl+[C], then Ctrl+[V] and press [Enter]
"Okay okay, this one guys, [GUARANTEED] [WIN]. [GUARANTEED]." [Whiskey] reassured his [chat]. However, several "BUH" sounds later, he managed an unfortunate 31st [place]. In a [panic], he shouted "OKAY OKAY, THAT ONE WAS JUST FOR [THE] [DRAMA], [CHAT], I SWEAR!" he said, desperately trying to [convince] his [chat] he wasn't just a [silly] [dingo].
WARNING: If your [pet] is [yellow], has a [SEVERE] [skill] [issue], [talks] very [loudly], never [takes] [showers] and is [VERY] [bad] at [video] [games], that means your [pet] has been [victim] of a new [virus] called “[Whiskey]-[621]” you must return him or send him to the so called “[dungeons]” where it’s the only place where they can [cure] your [pet]. BEWARE!!!
[Whiskey], the [streamer] who is soon to be [dethroned] by the [Goob] [Federation], I have some tips to help you out with this. Did you know, you can [move] [in] [any] [direction]? Also, [dying] is [generally] [bad], so [avoid] that. Also also, acquiring some [gaming] [skill] helps a bunch
Hey, everyone! I’m [Wiwinky] [Didingi], or [Wonky] for short, like my [height]! I’ve been a [weirdo] for the [majority] of my [life], and I’d like to [uWu] [OwO] [uWu] with all of you! I mainly play [high-quality] games, like [Garten] of [Banban], and [PizzaFace], and used to be an [old] [school] showering-every-other-day [vet]. However, I’ll be playing all sorts of [weird] [shit]! So [grab] a [pants], [kick] your [cereal] into the [toilet], and [enjoy] while I make a [Texan] of myself.
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! The [level] [titles] can contain [useful] [information] that will [prevent] you from [dying] which you CANNOT [understand] right now!
The first rule of [burritos] is that [burritos] are best when they’re also [quesadillas]. Hence why the Quesarito exists. We start with a [quesadilla], and then treat that [quesadilla] like a [burrito], full of [seasoned] [beef], creamy [chipotle] [sauce], reduced fat [sour] [cream], [nacho] [cheese] sauce, and [seasoned] [rice]. The second rule of [burritos] is that there are no rules to [burritos]. So technically, it’s OK for that [first] rule to be a little loose on the rule scale. Just go with it.
Hi WhiskeyDing0 - It’s me, your [only] [viewer]. For [months] I have created the [illusion] that you are [streaming] to a [large] [audience]. But here’s the [truth]: all these [people] in the chat are [me]. And now, for you to be [convinced] of this, I will [send] this [message] from all my [accounts].
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of [skill] and [streamer] compatibilty, [WhiskeyDingo] is the best at [having] [issues]? He has a high [confidence] stat, which makes him [more] [likely] to [mess] [up] while [attempting] a [risky] move. He also has a high [pepega] stat, meaning he is more [likely] to [forgor]. He [throws] like a [Heisman] [winner] every time he streams, it's [fucking] [impressive].
There was a day when I had [little] [cheddar]. Times were [hard]. Then I [started] [doubting]. I [win] every time. Now, I'm [rolling] in [cheddar].
[WhiskeyDing0] is a [streamer] who should not be [trusted]. His [blatant] [manipulation] of [mathematical] odds in [gambling] is definitive proof of an [untrustworthy] [individual]. Nobody trusts this [dingo] with [cheddar], as he will [likely] mis-[handle] it. If you [value] your [cheddar], stop [betting] in [WhiskeyDing0] streams today.
"[THE] [LAG] [IS] [BACK]" [whiskey] screams as [whiskey] begins to [lose], completely [falling] [behind] the large pack of [jelly] [bean] shaped [characters], the [chat] fills with "[OMEGALUL]" and "[KEKW]" as [whiskey] [falls] time after time, [falling] [further] and [further] from the [leader] of the [pack]. Soon the [game] [pauses] as [whiskey] finds the letters "[ELIMINATED]" in big letters on the screen, the [chat] once again fills with "[KEKW] [ME] [ENJOY]" and others of [chat]'s favorite [copy] [pastas], [whiskey] has [lost] again [KEKW]
Whiskey [WATCH] [OUT]! [Standing] for [long] [periods] can [hurt] your [feet] very [easily], unless you have the perk that gives you [good] [arch] [support], which you DON'T HAVE!
This [copypasta] has been brought to you by the "[Whiskey]'s [Copypastas] for [Pepegas]" community [Google] Document. Originally [created] by [Cerulean], it has been up since [November] [2022], and [remains] the Number 1 [repository] for all of Whiskey's [favorite] [copypastas]. Make sure to [stop] [by] today!
PotFriend - The [Voice] from [above] speaks: "Perform a [Grip] [Hold] with your [dominant] hand over your [shoulder], [thumb] facing down. The [other] hand's [palm] is at your [waist]. Its [thumb] should face [forward]." This Form is very [popular]...and [flattering]. The [Voice] was not [immune] to its [charms] and would often [show] [off] this [Form] from several [angles], asking which was its [good] [side]. - PotFriend
